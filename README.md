# ERP Backend

## Overview

Welcome to the ERP Backend repository! This backend system is designed and developed by Liem Nguyen and Hoang Ngo, with valuable input from Lam Pham as the Business Analyst.

## Project Overview

This ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) backend is built using the **Python Django** framework and leverages the power of the Django Rest Framework for seamless API integration. The goal of this project is to provide a robust and efficient backend solution for an integrated enterprise management system.

## Key Technologies
